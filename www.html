            <U>The World Wide Web</U> Consortium <U>(W3C)</U> was founded by <b>Tim Berners-Lee</b> after 
            he left the European Organization for Nuclear Research<U>(CERN)</U> in September/October 1994 in order
           to create open standards for the Web.[53] It was founded at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
           Laboratory for Computer Science <U>(MIT/LCS)</U>with support from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency <U>(DARPA)</U>, 
           which had pioneered the Internet.<BR>
            <H2>INTRODUCTION</H2>
            A year later, a second site was founded at <b>INRIA</b> <U>(a French national computer research lab) </U> with support from the European Commission; and in 1996,
             a third continental site was created in Japan at Keio University.
             <b>W3C</b> comprised various companies that were willing to create standards and recommendations to improve the quality of the Web.
             Berners-Lee made <i>the Web available freely</i>, with no patent and no royalties due. The W3C decided that its standards must be based on <b>royalty-free technology</b>, 
             so they can be easily adopted by anyone.
              Netscape and Microsoft, in the middle of a browser war, 
              ignored the <U>W3C</U> and added elements to HTML <hr>

 <p>The model was later popularized by Apple's HyperCard system. Unlike Hypercard, Berners-Lee's new system from the outset was meant to support
     links between multiple databases on independent computers, and to allow simultaneous access by many users from any computer on the Internet. He also specified that the system should eventually handle other media besides text, such as graphics, speech, and video.
      Links could refer to mutable data files, or even fire up programs on their server computer. He also conceived "gateways" that would allow access through the new system to documents organized in other ways (such as traditional computer file systems or the Uucp News). 
      Finally, he insisted that the system should be decentralized, without any central control or coordination over the creation of links.[3][10][11][12]
    Berners-Lee submitted a proposal to CERN in May 1989, without giving the system a name.[3] He got a working system implemented by the end of 1990, including a browser called WorldWideWeb (which became the name of the project and of the network) and an HTTP server running at CERN.
     As part of that development he defined the first version of the HTTP protocol, the basic URL syntax, and implicitly made HTML the primary document format.[15] The technology was released outside CERN to other research institutions starting in January 1991, and then to the whole Internet on 23 August 1991.
      The Web was a success at CERN, and began to spread to other scientific and academic institutions. Within the next two years, there were 50 websites created.[16][17]
    
    CERN made the Web protocol and code available royalty free in 1993, enabling its widespread use.[18][19] After the NCSA released the Mosaic web browser later that year, the Web's popularity grew rapidly as thousands of websites sprang up in less than a year.
    [20][21] Mosaic was a graphical browser that could display inline images and submit forms that were processed by the HTTPd server.[22][23] Marc Andreessen and Jim Clark founded Netscape the following year and released the Navigator browser, which introduced Java and JavaScript to the Web. 
    It quickly became the dominant browser. Netscape became a public company in 1995 which triggered a frenzy for the Web and started the dot-com bubble.[24] Microsoft responded by developing its own browser, Internet Explorer, starting the browser wars. By bundling it with Windows, it became the dominant browser for 14 years.[25]
    
    Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) which created XML in 1996 and recommended replacing HTML with stricter XHTML.[26] In the meantime, developers began exploiting an IE feature called XMLHttpRequest to make Ajax applications and launched the Web 2.0 revolution.
     Mozilla, Opera, and Apple rejected XHTML and created the WHATWG which developed HTML5.[27] In 2009, the W3C conceded and abandoned XHTML.[28] In 2019, it ceded control of the HTML specification to the WHATWG.[29]
    
    The World Wide Web has been central to the development of the Information Age and is the primary tool billions of people use to interact on the Internet.[30][31][32][33]</p>
